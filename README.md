I Have created Power BI dashboard on "Passenger Trend Analysis".

Dataset Source : Kaggle

Features :

Trend Analysis: Visualize the changes in passenger numbers over time using line charts and time series graphs.

Key Metrics: Analyze metrics such as total passenger count, year-over-year growth, and monthly/quarterly variations.

Segmentation: Break down passenger data by demographic factors like age, gender, and ticket type (e.g., first class, economy).

Geospatial Insights: Visualize passenger data on a map to identify high-traffic routes, regions, or cities.

Forecasting: Leverage Power BIâ€™s forecasting tools to predict future passenger trends based on historical data.
